# R2PQ Project Governance

## Project Steward
Founder & Lead Maintainer: **Eric James Newman**

## Core Maintainers
Core maintainers have:
- Commit access  
- Authority to review and merge pull requests  
- Responsibility for project quality and stability  

New maintainers are added by unanimous approval of existing maintainers.

## Decision Process
R2PQ uses a "maintainer consensus with founder veto" model:
- Maintainers discuss and vote on proposals  
- The Founder holds final tie-breaking authority  

## Release Process
1. Features merged into `main`  
2. Tagged release created using Semantic Versioning  
3. Release notes published in `r2pq-docs`  

## Goals
- Ensure long-term ecosystem stability  
- Maintain trust in security-critical components  
- Protect the R2PQ brand and identity
